# BriteDocs - Versioning Overview 

BriteDocs offers a flexible approach to versioning. There are three types of versions that exist in the system. **Table 1 **summarizes each version type.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>BriteCore versions</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>System-generated versions</td>
    <td>All new templates are automatically saved as system-generated versions by default. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Named versions</td>
    <td>Allows users to apply naming conventions for storing  and accessing different versions of the same template.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Published versions</td>
    <td>Users must assign a publish date to activate a template  in BriteCore. </td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Note:** As a best practice, we recommend creating a new version of your template before you revise it.
